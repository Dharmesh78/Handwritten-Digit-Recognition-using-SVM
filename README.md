# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-SVM
1.1	Introduction
Hand writing recognition of characters has been around since the 1980s.The task of handwritten digit recognition, using a classifier, has great importance and use such as – online handwriting recognition on computer tablets, recognize zip codes on mail for postal mail sorting, processing bank check amounts, numeric entries in forms filled up by hand (for example ‐ tax forms) and so on. There are different challenges faced while attempting to solve this problem. The handwritten digits are not always of the same size, thickness, or orientation and position relative to the margins. Our goal was to implement a pattern classification method to recognize the handwritten digits provided in the MNIST dataset of images of hand written digits (0 ‐ 9). The data set used for our application is composed of 300 training images and 300 testing images, and is a subset of the MNIST data set (originally composed of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images). Each image is a 28 x 28 grayscale (0 ‐ 255) labeled representation of an individual digit. The general problem we predicted we would face in this digit classification problem was the similarity between the digits like 1 and 7, 5 and 6, 3 and 8, 9 and 8 etc. Finally the uniqueness and variety in the handwriting of different individuals also influences the formation and appearance of the digits.
